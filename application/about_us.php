                        <p class="lead text-justify">We believed that people will feel good when they look good and this should
                            applies to everyone. </p>
                            
                        <p class="lead text-justify">Thus we have a group of experienced hairstylist to start a salon
                            that not only offers professional hair services for our customers, but also to have
                            subsidized services for the disadvantaged, vulnerable or special needs, which are partly
                            funded with our pay-it-forward programme. </p>

                        <p class="lead text-justify">Currently, we offer a full range of trending hair services for all
                            hairdressing needs: cut, style, dye, treatment etc. We are partnered with established
                            brands like Shiseido, L'oreal, Uppecut to offer a range of products for our
                            customers to choose from.</p>
                        <p class="lead text-justify">We too have started a mobile haircut service for those who face
                            inconveniences moving around. Prices are reasonable as we are aware that what the
                            general public consider as a basic service may not be so for those who face logistics
                            challenges. </p>

                        <p class="lead text-justify">Kindness with dignity is our motto. Our hope is that people pay kindness
                            forward in every little way to brighten up the society as a whole. This can start as an
                            opportunity to sponsor a haircut to the needy/disadvantaged and/or financially
                            distressed.</p>
